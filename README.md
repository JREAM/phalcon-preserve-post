# Phalcon Preserve Post

This is just a simple way to preserve form data in 3 steps.

- This uses plain $_SESSION data
- $_SESSION data is reset once viewed
- Your Session must be started before-hand (Phalcon Session)

I did not want to use the Form libraries for forms, nor did I want to use the
flash Messages container because this is automatic and quite easy.

If you find a better way to do this let me know!
